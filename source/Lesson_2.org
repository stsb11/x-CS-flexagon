- Initially, your flexagon will be rather stiff and difficult to move. 
- The video below will help you get the hang of moving it around:

- Once you've got the hang of changing the state of the flexagon, see if you can produce a map of all the different states, by finding all of the numbered sequences from 0 to 8. 
- Remember that you can only change to a state if there are a pair of letters side by side.
- Look at the example below:
[[./img/l2_start.jpg]]
- In the picture above, the flexagon is in state 3 (the central set of values). We'll refer to this as our /initial state/. 
- We could change to state *a* or *b* from this state, as the letters are on touching edges of different triangles. 
- No other side will allow a change as there are no other touching letters (don't try, as you'll break the flexagon).
